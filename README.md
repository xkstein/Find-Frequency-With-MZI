# Find Frequency With MZI

The design idea for this project was to do everything with functions and global variables and avoid making a big class with random ass functions to puppet everything. This made it easier to migrate over from notebooks and I like it conceptually, but the code is sort of a mess and there are hella footguns.

# Installation

In a python virtual environment run `pip install -r requirements.txt`

Then run `pip install -e .` and you can launch the application with `python -m mzitool`

(or just enter `mzitool/` and run `python main.py`)

# TODO
+ Work on Q finding stuff
