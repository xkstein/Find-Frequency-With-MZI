# Find Frequency With MZI

The design idea for this project was to do everything with functions and global variables and avoid making a big class with random ass functions to puppet everything. This made it easier to migrate over from notebooks and I like it conceptually, but the code is sort of a mess and there are hella footguns.

# TODO
+ Reduce saved frequency to np.float32
+ Add darkpoint (and maybe reduce transmission to int16)
+ Work on Q finding stuff
